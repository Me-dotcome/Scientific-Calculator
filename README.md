# Scientific-Calculator
This is a basic calculator application with a graphical user interface. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), some level of complex operations (trigonometry, factorials, percentage), and handles exceptions such as division by zero.

# Project Overview

I was required to develop a programming project which uses a graphical user interface.   
The project is meant to incorporate the core constructs of sequencing, selection and iteration and handling exceptions.   
I should also make use of the data structures and algorithms explored throughout my Introductory Programming module.   
The project should be managed using Github and demonstrate effective code management.  
The aim of the project is for me to implement the knowledge learnt into the writing of the code for the scientific calculator, using different methods in order to touch on key requirements for the assignment.

# Description for use
The product is a scientific calculator application. It is used to make day to day calculations like addition and subtractions, with more functionalities like sine() and factorials. 

Clicking on the buttons to be used like the numbers and functions is how to make calculations. Using the history buttons to scan through already made calculations and receiving an Error message when an incorrect format of calculations is made is one of the many features and guidelines to using this application.

There are also four keys on your keyboard that should be able to interact with the calculator. These four keys are the backspace, return , the up and the down arrow keys. The number buttons on your keyboard can also be used to input numbers into the calculator, preferably, use the buttons on the application to best interact with the application.
